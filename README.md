# home-genie-nodemcu

Arduino sketch of an IoT home automation system built using NodeMCU. This project was done as a part of FTFL IoT training.

## About This Project
- This project demonstrates application of IoT using few LEDs and a DC motor. These components can be controlled over the internet.
- In addition to the LEDs and the motor, a PIR motion sensor and a thermistor are also integrated to demonstrate automation.
- The system uses MQTT messaging protocol to communicate over the internet.
- The system includes an [android app](https://github.com/sohelaman/home-genie-android) which is used to control the components, i.e. the LEDs and the motor. There is also a web control dashboard.
- The android app enables user to control the devices manually and through some voice commands.
